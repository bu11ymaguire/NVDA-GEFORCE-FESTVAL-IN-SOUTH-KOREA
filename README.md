NVIDIA GEFORCE FESTIVAL IN SOUTH KOREA

Thanks to my Instagram ad algorithm being biased towards IT conferences, I found out about and applied for the GeForce Festival.

It happened to overlap with the APEC summit period, and with news that CEO Jensen Huang would also be visiting Korea, I started to wonder, "Could he actually show up at the event?" (To be honest, I was more excited about buying something from the gift shop than seeing him.)

On October 30, 2025, I attended the festival at KOEX, celebrating the 25th anniversary of NVIDIA GeForce.

Jensen Huang mentioned he had just had "chimaek" (chicken and beer) with Samsung's Chairman Jay Y. Lee and Hyundai's Chairman Euisun Chung before coming. From his perspective, this was a visit 15 years in the making—returning to a country where his connection began 30 years ago with a letter from the late Chairman Lee Kun-hee, all after NVIDIA reached a $5 trillion market cap. For the audience, seeing the CEO of the world's number one company be so approachable and friendly seemed like a win-win for everyone.

It was especially interesting to see the "crosstalk" between these major corporate leaders firsthand. (Chairman Lee joked to the crowd filming him, "I see a lot of iPhones," and Chairman Chung remarked that he was surprisingly the youngest one there. You can likely find more details about this on YouTube.)

Personally, what impressed me the most were two stories: the fact that 30 years ago, Chairman Lee Kun-hee saw the vision for GPUs and sent Jensen Huang a personal handwritten letter, and the fact that Jensen Huang himself used to visit the Yongsan Electronics Market back in the day, just trying to sell one more GPU.
